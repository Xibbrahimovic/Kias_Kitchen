## Getting Started


### Prerequisites


Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository 
2. Set up a database called kias-kitchen. Using the database.sql file provided, create your tables and add some data(if you have some pre-existing data already).
3. Run the 'npm install' command to automatically install all necessary dependencies.
4. Split your terminals in your code editor so you can 'npm run server' in one server to get the server up and running. Then 'npm run client' to find yourself on http://localhost:3000/. 
5. Enjoy yourself in the app :D
