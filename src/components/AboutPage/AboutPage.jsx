        <p>Our application was 
inspired by Kiaâ€™s work in
the kitchen throughout 
her life. Whatever dish 
that she cooks up has 
always been in the company 
of the people she loved. Often times, she 
has kept recipes to which were not always 
originals, but shared with her to create new 
memories together. </p>
